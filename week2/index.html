        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about text-left">
            <p>My name is Jonelle Harris and I am 22 years old. Before I got into tech, I initially pursued my previous "passion" in the arts by going 
            to an art school. When the pandemic took the world by storm and everywhere was locked down, I decided to explore my other interest in 
            computers and other technology and further develop my skills. I took a class learning skills and techniques within the IT industry and 
            while I was in the class I found that the tech field is where I'm most passionate in. I decided afterwards that I wanted to continue 
            to learn more about computers and coding and I took another class learning how to code. After the class, I felt that I wanted to further 
            my knowledge in coding as I ultimately decided to pursue a career in software development. I am currently taking a bootcamp course in 
            coding at the University of Toronto as I believe that with their knowledgeable staff and resources, they will help me reach my goals and
            aid me to my path to success.</p>
